Let us, like these good shepherds, then\nemploy\nOur grateful voices to proclaim the joy;\nTrace we the babe, who hath retrieved our\nloss,\nFrom His poor manger to His bitter cross;\nTread in His steps, assisted by His grace,\nTill man\u0027s first heavenly state again takes\nplace.\n\n6. Then may we hope, th\u0027angelic hosts among,\nTo sing, redeemed, a glad triumphant song;\nHe that was born upon this joyful day\nAround us all His glory shall display;\nSaved by His love, incessant we shall sing\nEternal praise to heaven\u0027s Almighty King.\n",
